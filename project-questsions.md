# Project Planning Questsions

Taken from **Making Things Happen** by Scott Berkun, Published by O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2008

## Business Perspective

* Why is this project needed for our business?
* What unmet needs or desires do our customers have?
* What features or services might we provide that will meet those desires and needs?
* On what basis will customers purchase this product or service?
* What will motivate them to do so?What will it cost (people/resources)?
* Over what time period?
* What potential for revenue (or reduced organizational operating costs) does it have?
* Over what time period?What won’t we build so that we can build this?
* Will it contribute to our long-term business strategy or protect other revenue-generating assets? (Even nonprofits or IT organizations have a business strategy: there are always bills to pay, revenue to obtain, or revenue-generating groups to support.)
* How will this help us match, outflank, or beat competitors?
* What are the market time windows that we should target for this project?

## Technology Perspective

What does it (the project) need to do?

How will it work? How will each of the components in it work?

How will we build it? How will we verify that it works as it’s supposed to?

How reliable, efficient, extensible, and performant are the current systems or ones we are capable of building? Is there a gap between this and what the project requires?

What technologies or architectures are readily available to us? Will we bet on any new technologies that will be available soon but are not available yet?

What engineering processes and approaches are appropriate for this team and this project?

What applicable knowledge and expertise do our people have? What won’t they be working on to work on this project?

How will we fill gaps in expertise? (Train/hire/learn/ignore and hope the gaps magically go away.)

How much time will it take to build, at what level of quality?
